**EduFoundation International** is an international humanitarian foundation that is committed to fighting poverty and providing African Countries with basic amenities and relief during the time of disasters and natural calamities. It runs a lot of operational projects from time to time along with advocacy drives to raise awareness as well as for funding purposes.

 

After the recent funding programmes, they have been able to raise around $ 1 million. Now the CEO needs to decide how to use this money strategically and effectively. The significant issues that come while making this decision are mostly related to choosing the countries that are in the direst need of aid. 



And this is where we  come in as a data analyst. Our job is to categorise the countries using some socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country. Then suggest the countries which the CEO needs to focus on the most. 

My main task is to cluster the countries by the factors mentioned above and then present the solution. The following approach is suggested :


- Also, We need to perform visualisations on the clusters that have been formed.  


- Both K-means and Hierarchical may give different results because of previous analysis (whether We chose to keep or remove the outliers, how many clusters We chose,  etc.) Hence, there might be some subjectivity in the final number of countries that We think should be reported back to the CEO since they depend upon the preceding analysis as well. Here, make sure that We report back at least 5 countries which are in direst need of aid from the analysis work that we perform.
